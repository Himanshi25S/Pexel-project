A Pexels Clone is a simple web application that mimics the look and feel of Pexels, a platform for free stock photos and videos. It typically features a clean, user-friendly interface with a search bar for finding images, a gallery of photos displayed in a grid, and navigation options for home, explore, upload, and user login.
